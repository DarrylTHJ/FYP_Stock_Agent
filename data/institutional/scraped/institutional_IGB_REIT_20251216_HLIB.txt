Sector coverage: REIT
Company description: A REIT that consists of Mid Post lifting of restriction, we resume coverage on IGBREIT with the following updates:
Valley Megamall, The Gardens Mall and Mid Valley
Southkey in Malaysia. MVS injection completed. The injection of Mid Valley Southkey Mall (MVS) into
IGBREIT was completed on 21 November 2025, representing a meaningful
Share price expansion to the REIT’s portfolio. Based on IGB REIT’s 3Q25 TAV of RM5.72bn, the
RM2.65bn acquisition lifts TAV by 46.3% and is funded through RM1bn of additional
debt, which raises gearing to 26.3% from 21%, and RM1.65bn of equity via the
issuance of 699,152,542 consideration units at RM2.36 per unit. MVS is almost fully
occupied at 99.97%, demonstrating resilient tenant demand, while the one-off
RM30m management fee tied to the acquisition has been excluded from our FY25
bottom line estimates. The mall’s direct connectivity via the EDL Highway to the CIQ
complex positions it well to capture cross-border traffic between Malaysia and
Singapore.

We resume coverage on IGBREIT with a HOLD call and TP of RM2.57, pegged
to FY26 targeted yield of 5.0%. While the overall outlook remains constructive,
underpinned by steady rental reversion and the incremental contribution from the
Southkey portfolio, we believe the current valuation already reflects much of the near-
term upside, preventing us from having a bullish stance.
