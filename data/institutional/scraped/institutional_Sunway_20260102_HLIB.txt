Sunway l Company Update
What happens after healthcare listing? While the listing of SHH is a major strategic
milestone for Sunway, the SHH listing should be viewed as a launch pad not the finish
line for Sunway. Instead, the listing acts as a catalyst that broadens its capacity to
execute across multiple growth vectors. Firstly, the healthcare business continues to
anchor earnings. Post-listing, Sunway will retain a sizeable stake in SHH, ensuring the
healthcare division remains a core profit engine and providing continued upside from
SHH’s expansion trajectory. Importantly, Sunway now gains partial monetisation of its
healthcare platform without relinquishing long-term participation in SHH’s growth cycle.
Secondly, capital recycling deepens Sunway’s strategic firepower. Proceeds from the
listing (potentially close to RM900m) can be redeployed into higher-return opportunities
across the group. The most visible redeployment pathway is the property segment. The
incapital infusion could accelerate the build-out of strategic assets in Sunway City
Iskandar Puteri (SCIP) township and the Sunway-RTS TOD, positioning Sunway to
capture JS-SEZ upside and the structural demand around RTS connectivity.
Concurrently, Sunway Construction stands to benefit from strong DC build-out and a
potential infrastructure upcycle ahead of general election, providing sustained earnings
visibility.
Beyond property and construction, Sunway is nurturing several scalable businesses —
most notably its pharmacy venture and credit reporting platform. In this context, market
attention is likely to gravitate towards the anticipated Big Caring Group listing in 2026,
with report from Bloomberg suggesting a valuation of up to RM20bn. Such an event
could establish a valuation benchmark for Sunway’s pharmacy business and surface
latent portfolio value.
Forecast. Unchanged.
Maintain BUY with an unchanged TP of RM6.05, based on SOP valuation. With its
expanding footprint across key sectors of the Malaysian economy, Sunway remains a
compelling proxy to domestic growth, which is entering a new phase driven by structural
reforms.
