Private Credit
Consumer financing – motor financing
Acquisition and immediate optimisation. OSK recently completed its acquisition of Wilayah
Credit on 1 Aug 2025 for RM16.5m. Wilayah Credit is a motorcycle financing company with a
customer base concentrated mainly in Johor and KL, and carries a loan portfolio of approximately
RM40m. Immediately after the acquisition, OSK refinanced Wilayah Credit’s borrowings, reducing
its cost of funds from ~8% to ~4.5%. This refinancing alone should provide the segment with
meaningful interest cost savings. Following the acquisition, OSK undertook a comprehensive
portfolio housekeeping exercise, including a full review of all the credits within the portfolio and non-
performing loans (NPLs). As part of a stricter credit classification approach in line with standard
practice, all accounts with repayment overdue for more than 90 days were reclassified as NPLs,
resulting in an impairment charge of around RM2m in 3Q. This early clean-up positions the business
on a more sustainable footing and reduces the risk of legacy surprises.
Strengthening operations. Concurrently, OSK has begun to rebuild operational relationships and
strengthen market intelligence. Management has re-engaged with the motorcycle dealer network
to restore sales channels, while the team actively studies customer behaviour, market dynamics
and product preferences. This includes on-the-ground visits and discussions with motorcycle
distributors. These efforts should help OSK refine its product offering, sharpen its underwriting
standards and reposition motor financing for scalable, disciplined growth.
Resilient credit dynamics in the gig economy. With these initiatives in place, the segment is well
positioned to scale meaningfully from FY26 onwards, particularly in the Klang Valley where demand
for motorcycle financing remains structurally strong. The gig economy, especially in the food
delivery and parcel logistics continues to expand rapidly, and motorcycles serve as an essential
income-generating asset for ride-hailing workers. For this customer segment, loan repayment is
closely aligned with daily cash flow because the motorcycle directly enables their income. As a
result, borrowers are generally more motivated to maintain repayment discipline, as any disruption
to vehicle ownership would immediately impair their ability to generate income. This creates a more
resilient credit profile relative to discretionary consumer loans and provides OSK with a more
predictable risk-return framework as it scales the motor financing business.
New debt recovery team. OSK has recently established a dedicated debt recovery team led by an
industry veteran with deep expertise in consumer credit collection and portfolio rehabilitation. With
OSK’s private credit loan portfolio having expanded significantly in recent years, the loan book has
reached a scale where building an in-house recovery capability is both commercially viable and
strategically important. This enables OSK to manage credit quality more proactively, standardise
recovery processes and capture efficiencies that would not have been meaningful when the portfolio
was smaller.
Dual mandate to drive efficiencies and new revenue stream. The team operates with a dual-
function mandate that enhances its strategic value. First, internal recovery efforts strengthen
delinquency management, accelerate cash collections and improve overall asset quality across
OSK’s lending portfolios. Second, the team can engage in external recovery, representing a
potential new revenue stream by acquiring third-party NPL portfolios and applying specialised
strategies to extract value. Early results on internal recovery have been encouraging, with
meaningful NPL recoveries in the motor financing segment, improving cash flows and raising the
potential for impairment write-backs in 4Q25.
Consumer Credit Act – a structural tailwind to motor financing
Consumer Credit Act implementation timeline. The Consumer Credit Act (CCA) is Malaysia’s
new regulatory framework aimed at bringing all consumer-credit providers, including motor
financing, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), leasing, credit sales and debt collection, under a unified,
modernised regulatory regime. The Act was passed in 2023, followed by the establishment of the
Consumer Credit Oversight Board (CCOB), which will regulate non-bank lenders alongside Bank
Negara Malaysia (BNM). Implementation will take place in phases:
• 2024–2025 (Phase 1): Drafting of subsidiary legislation, operational guidelines and
licensing requirements. Voluntary registration opens, enabling existing lenders to transition
into the new framework.
2 HLIB Research l www.hlebroking.com
OSK Holdings l Company Update
• 2025–2026 (Phase 2): Formal licensing window opens. All existing consumer-credit
providers must apply for a licence to continue operating. CCOB begins supervisory
oversight.
• By 2027: Full enforcement. Only licensed entities can legally offer consumer financing or
credit services. Unlicensed or non-compliant operators will be required to exit the market.
Once fully rolled out, every lender, regardless of size must be licensed, ensuring sector-wide
standardisation, transparency, and consumer protection.
CCA as a structural tailwind. The mandatory licensing requirement marks a major structural shift
for the motor financing landscape. Historically, the sector has been populated by many small or
informal operators with limited regulatory oversight. With the CCA in force, the compliance bar rises
meaningfully, ushering in a more controlled and transparent market environment.
Market consolidation benefits licensed players. The higher regulatory threshold is expected to
catalyse industry consolidation. Smaller, informal or undercapitalised lenders may struggle to meet
licensing, governance and reporting standards, leading to natural attrition. As these players exit,
market share flows toward licensed, well-capitalised institutions such as OSK, effectively expanding
the formal addressable market.
Consumer financing – civil servant financing
Civil servant pay hike. In 2024, the government has introduced a major salary adjustment for civil
servants, to be implemented in two phases as below:
Phase 1 (effective 1 Dec 2024):
• +8% for most civil servants, or minimum +RM240 for lower grades.
• +4% for senior/top management.
Phase 2 (effective 1 Jan 2026):
• additional +7% for most grades.
• additional +3% for senior/top management.
Overall, lower and mid-level civil servants will see total increases of around 13–15%, while senior
management receives about 7% cumulatively.
Ops Sky event. While the civil servant pay hike was expected to be a strong tailwind for OSK’s civil
servant loan portfolio, the timing unfortunately coincided with the Ops Sky investigation, which
disrupted the broader personal-financing industry. In early 2025, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission (MACC) launched Ops Sky, a corruption and money-laundering probe targeting a loan
syndicate involving a financial-consultancy firm that colluded with bank officers across several
banks.
How the scheme works. The syndicate exploited a timing gap in the credit reporting system by
submitting multiple personal-loan applications for their clients (often civil servants), across several
banks and non-bank lenders within the same narrow window. As new applications do not
immediately appear in CCRIS, each lender believed it was the only institution assessing the
borrower and approved the loan, when in reality the borrower already had multiple concurrent
applications. Many of these loans would have been rejected had lenders known the borrower was
simultaneously applying elsewhere.
NPL spike across lenders. Most clients were unaware they were part of a fraudulent scheme; they
believed the consultancy to be a legitimate loan agent and did not know it was falsifying documents
or submitting multiple applications behind the scenes. In many cases, the proceeds from several
approved loans were credited to the borrower at once, often resulting in debt levels far beyond their
repayment capacity. Unable to service these unexpected commitments, borrowers fell into arrears,
while lenders, particularly those with exposure to civil servant financing, experienced a spike in
NPLs. This in turn forced lenders industry-wide to tighten underwriting standards and slow down
approval volumes to manage the elevated risk environment.
Minimal impact to OSK. Our recent engagement with OSK management team indicates that
OSK’s loan exposure to Ops Sky is minimal. We believe this low exposure was not accidental but
reflects OSK’s robust and disciplined credit approval process.
3 HLIB Research l www.hlebroking.com
OSK Holdings l Company Update
Strong risk discipline driving improving asset quality. Following the exposure of Ops Sky in
early 2025, OSK further strengthened underwriting standards and intentionally slowed growth in the
civil servant segment to closely observe repayment trends. This demonstrates the group’s
commitment to financial discipline in avoiding growth at the expense of asset quality. The aim is to
keep the NPL rate within the acceptable range of 1-1.5%. With the Ops Sky incident largely behind
the industry, 2026 should offer a clearer runway for OSK to capitalise on the second phase of the
civil servant pay hike, scheduled for implementation in Jan 2026.
Consumer financing – freelance financing
Scaling down Lyte. In 2021, OSK established a fintech platform named Lyte in partnership with
Lyte Ventures (a Singapore-based company). OSK holds a 51% stake, while Lyte Ventures owns
the remaining 49%. Lyte provides financing solutions to freelancers and SMEs, targeting a niche
segment of the gig economy. The group has now decided to scale down this business, allowing
existing loans to run off and eventually winding down the platform. There are two key reasons
driving this decision. First, the addressable market for freelancer and micro-SME financing is
relatively limited, making it difficult to scale the portfolio to a meaningful size. Second, the NPL
experience in this segment has been comparatively high. Given the weaker risk-return trade-off,
OSK believes capital and management resources are better allocated to segments where it has
stronger credit visibility, scalability and sustainable economics.
Regional expansion to Singapore
Establishing a regional base in Singapore. OSK has recently set up a new private credit office
in Singapore, with its first loan disbursement expected as early as 2026. While the immediate focus
is on the Singapore market, the strategic intent is broader. As a regional financial hub with deep
capital markets and strong deal flow, Singapore provides OSK with an ideal launch pad to originate,
structure and syndicate private credit opportunities across the wider APAC region. This presence
also enhances OSK’s visibility with regional sponsors, intermediaries and institutional investors,
supporting future scaling of its private credit franchise.
Building on a legacy in credit. Importantly, OSK is not starting from a blank slate in regional
private credit. Prior to the RHB–OSK Investment Bank (OSKIB) merger in 2012, OSKIB managed
a sizeable private credit portfolio in Indonesia, alongside other regional banking operations that
were subsequently acquired by RHB. The group therefore retains institutional memory, networks
and underwriting experience in cross-border credit. Building on this legacy, we believe OSK is well
placed to re-establish itself in the regional private credit space and gradually grow a differentiated
APAC-focused platform out of Singapore.
An underpenetrated segment. The APAC private credit market remains structurally
underpenetrated despite its rapid growth. According to Preqin, private credit AUM in the region
expanded from USD15.4bn in 2014 to USD92.9bn by September 2023—a sixfold increase,
representing a CAGR of just over 22% (see Figure #1). Yet, even with this impressive trajectory,
penetration remains low relative to developed markets. KKR estimates that as at March 2023, non-
bank credit represented only 21% of total credit in APAC, compared with 46% in Europe and 67%
in the US (see Figure #2). This wide gap underscores the substantial headroom for private lenders
as regional banks tighten credit standards, corporates seek alternative funding sources and
institutional investors increasingly allocate to private credit for yield and diversification.

Setting up a new private credit fund in Australia
Licensing milestone unlocks third-party capital. In Australia, OSK has secured the necessary
licence that enables it to raise third-party capital through the establishment of a new private credit
fund. This marks an important strategic milestone. Historically, OSK’s lending activities have been
financed primarily through its own balance sheet, meaning growth was naturally constrained by the
group’s gearing limits and debt headroom. With the ability to raise external capital, OSK can now
significantly scale its credit platform without drawing heavily on its own balance sheet, preserving
financial flexibility while expanding its lending capacity.
Transition toward a capital-light, fee-based model. Under this new structure, OSK transitions
from being purely a balance-sheet lender into a dual-platform credit manager, deploying both
proprietary capital and investor capital. The economics also shift: instead of relying solely on interest
income, OSK will generate recurring management fees (and potentially performance fees) based
on the fund’s asset under management (AUM). This creates a more capital-light, annuity-like
income stream that is less sensitive to funding costs and gearing levels.
Pathway to scalable growth. OSK targets to launch the fund by early 2026 with an initial AUM
target of AUD50m. Successfully raising and deploying this fund would not only diversify earnings
but also build a track record that supports larger fund launches in the future. In essence, the
licensing approval positions OSK to develop a scalable, fee-driven private credit franchise that can
grow independently of the group’s own balance sheet constraints.
Private credit takes centre stage
Building a long-term growth engine in private credit. OSK demonstrated strong foresight in
identifying private credit as a core pillar of future growth. Since 2017, the group has been steadily
and deliberately expanding this segment. The segment began with the conventional corporate
lending business, but has today evolved into a highly diversified private credit platform, spanning
multiple consumer segments, product types, and geographies.
Growth without compromising asset quality. OSK’s private credit division delivered a robust 6-
year PBT CAGR of 25.1% from FY18–24. Importantly, this growth has not come at the expense of
asset quality. Each new lending segment that OSK enters undergoes years of research, pilot testing
and behavioural analysis, followed by an extended incubation period before any meaningful scaling
occurs. This methodical approach ensures that underwriting models are validated, risk controls are
refined and the group fully understands the credit dynamics of each segment before deploying
significant capital.
Structural tailwinds supporting the sector. Several macro and regulatory developments provide
a supportive backdrop for the segment. The civil servant pay hikes, implemented in phases
beginning Dec 2024 and Jan 2026, raises loan eligibility and strengthens repayment capacity,
5 HLIB Research l www.hlebroking.com
OSK Holdings l Company Update
directly benefiting OSK’s civil servant financing portfolio. Meanwhile, the Consumer Credit Act
mandates licensing for all consumer-credit providers, a move that is expected to raise industry
standards and drive consolidation. As smaller, unregulated operators exit the market, well-
capitalised and compliant lenders like OSK stand to gain share in a more orderly and regulated
environment. Collectively, these tailwinds reinforce OSK's growth story in its private credit franchise.
A new core earnings driver emerging. FY25 is likely to be the first year in which private credit
surpasses property as the largest profit contributor (excluding contribution from RHB), marking a
structural shift in OSK’s earnings profile. In our view, this mirrors the trajectory of Sunway
Healthcare, which for years was deeply embedded within a diversified conglomerate structure,
making it easy for investors to overlook its underlying growth and rising profitability. Only when the
business reached a meaningful scale did investors begin recognising its standalone value,
ultimately driving a significant re-rating of Sunway’s share price. Similarly, OSK’s private credit
segment has long been overshadowed by the group’s larger and more established property
businesses. As the division now gains size and visibility, we believe the market will begin to
reassess OSK’s valuation framework. A clearer appreciation of the private credit franchise could
pave the way for a re-rating.
Cables
One of the largest cable production capacities in Malaysia. In Sep 2024, OSK successfully
increased the production capacity of its Melaka factory by approximately 30% following the full
commissioning of new machinery and the optimisation of key processes through de-bottlenecking
initiatives. In the same month, the group announced the acquisition of cable factories and machinery
in JB from Universal Cable. With the Melaka expansion and this acquisition, OSK’s cable production
capacity has effectively more than doubled, bringing annual output to approximately 64,000 km,
positioning OSK as one of the largest cable producers in Malaysia by capacity.
Asset-only acquisition ensures a clean integration. Importantly, OSK opted to acquire only the
assets of Universal Cable rather than the corporate entity. This was a deliberate decision on OSK's
part as it ensures a clean and efficient transaction, allowing OSK to integrate the operational assets
while avoiding any potential legacy liabilities tied to the Universal Cable entity. As a result of this
asset-only structure, OSK was required to reapply for all relevant operating licences before
production could resume. This process was completed efficiently, enabling operations to commence
by Mar 2025. Although Universal Cable’s factories were technically capable of producing high-
voltage (HV) cables, the certifications were held by the Universal Cable entity, not the assets
themselves. Therefore, OSK has to apply for the HV cable certifications under its own name before
it can commercially produce and sell HV cables.
Understanding the divergence: Why SCG’s PBT outpaced OSK in 2024–25. Looking at Figure
#3, we compare the PBT contribution from OSK Industries segment with its closest listed peer,
Southern Cable Group (SCG). OSK Industries’ PBT is driven predominantly by its Cables division
(>80%), with the remainder coming from its IBS operations. Historically, both companies delivered
comparable PBT levels. However, beginning in 2024, SCG’s PBT accelerated sharply and moved
meaningfully ahead of OSK.
This divergence can be explained by several structural and timing factors. First, OSK’s production
capacity remained constrained for most of 2024. The 30% capacity uplift in Melaka only came online
in Sep 2024, while the capacity from the newly acquired JB factories began contributing only in Mar
2025. Second, OSK’s PBT in 2025 was temporarily weighed down by pre-operating expenses,
repair works and higher operating costs from the JB facilities. Since Mar 2025, the group has been
progressively overhauling machinery, production lines and plant infrastructure, an effort expected
to take slightly over a year to complete before unlocking full operational efficiency.
In addition to this, SCG also benefited from two additional revenue streams that OSK did not yet
have at the time:
• a fully operational HV cable business, and
• a growing US export market,
Both of these segments were major contributors to SCG’s growth. This structural advantage
widened the PBT gap during the period under review.

Re-convergence ahead: why the PBT gap should narrow from FY26 onwards. Looking ahead,
we expect the PBT differential between OSK and SCG to narrow from FY26, with OSK having the
potential to eventually catch up.
Several catalysts underpin this view:
1) Stabilisation and scaling of JB operations.
As the JB factories complete their full upgrading cycle and machinery reliability improves, OSK
should be able to ramp up utilisation progressively. The combined capacity of Melaka + JB positions
OSK as one of the largest cable producers in Malaysia, giving it a structural volume advantage.
2) Entry into the HV cable market.
OSK has already secured the necessary HV certifications and is currently undergoing the
registration process with a major domestic utility company. Upon registration, OSK will be eligible
to bid for HV cable tenders, positioning it as one of the only four HV-certified cable manufacturers
in Malaysia. This opens up a new revenue stream previously unavailable to OSK.
3) Strategic push into export markets.
OSK currently exports to a handful of countries, but export contribution remains an insignificant
portion of revenue. The group is now actively working to secure additional international
certifications, which will enable entry into new markets. Management is increasingly confident of
making tangible progress in this area, which would further diversify revenue and support margin
expansion.
Collectively, these developments position OSK on a strong footing for earnings re-acceleration.
Cable industry entering a multi-year super cycle. We believe the cable industry is at the
beginning of a structural multi-year upcycle, supported by several powerful demand drivers. The
most significant catalyst is the sharp rise in electricity consumption driven by the rapid expansion
of DCs. Hyperscale DCs require substantial cabling for grid connection, internal power distribution
and redundancy systems. With Malaysia experiencing one of the fastest DC build-outs in the region,
cable demand from this segment alone is expected to remain elevated over the medium term.
Electrification trends further reinforce this outlook. The growth of EV adoption necessitates
widespread installation of charging infrastructure and upgrades to distribution networks, all of which
rely heavily on MV/LV cables. At the same time, renewable energy investments are accelerating.
Upcoming solar programmes, including LSS5, LSS5+ and expansion of corporate solar schemes,
require extensive cabling from panel arrays to inverters, transformers and grid interconnections.
7 HLIB Research l www.hlebroking.com
OSK Holdings l Company Update
Infrastructure projects add another layer of support. Major developments such as the Penang LRT,
MRT3, industrial park expansions and grid-strengthening initiatives by TNB continue to drive steady
demand across LV, MV and HV segments. Collectively, these overlapping themes from DC growth,
EV electrification, renewable energy deployment and infrastructure expansion are creating a broad-
based uplift that underpins our view that the cable industry is entering a sustained super cycle.
Global cable industry is also in an upcycle. The global cable industry is likewise entering a
structural upcycle, driven by the same megatrends seen in Malaysia—renewable energy
deployment, grid modernisation, EV electrification and accelerating DC construction worldwide.
Utilities across the US, Europe and Asia are investing heavily to upgrade aging transmission
networks and expand grid capacity to accommodate rising electricity demand. This global push for
electrification and renewable integration is creating sustained, multi-year demand growth for LV,
MV and HV cables across all major markets.
US supply-chain diversification away from China a powerful catalyst. A significant global
tailwind comes from the US’ strategic move to diversify its cable supply chain away from China.
Heightened geopolitical risks, import restrictions and reshoring initiatives have prompted US utilities
and distributors to actively source cables from alternative markets. This shift has opened new export
opportunities for cable manufacturers outside China, particularly those able to meet US standards
and certification requirements. SCG has been a direct beneficiary of this trend, seeing strong export
traction into the US market, one of the key reasons its earnings accelerated sharply in recent years.
As the US continues to diversify suppliers, this represents a structurally positive demand driver for
compliant cable manufacturers in the region.
Should OSK list its cable business?
This is a reasonable consideration, especially given the cable industry's favourable dynamics and
the strong valuations enjoyed by domestic and global peers. Cable manufacturers typically trade at
high-teens to mid-20s forward PER, reflecting the sector’s robust earnings visibility during the
current super cycle. In contrast, OSK trades at only 7–8x forward PER, with the cable division
effectively “buried” inside a diversified conglomerate discount. Hence, from a valuation standpoint,
listing the cable business could therefore be immediately value-accretive, as the market would likely
re-rate the standalone cable entity closer to peer multiples, unlocking value that is currently not
reflected in OSK’s share price.
Structural advantages of staying within the group. However, in our view, keeping the cable
segment within the group yields greater long-term value. The recent Universal Cable asset
acquisition illustrates this point well. OSK completed the deal at a price of RM85m. As the cable
division sits within a financially strong parent, OSK was able to secure financing at lower borrowing
costs, a benefit that may not be available if the cable division were a standalone listed company. A
separately listed entity would likely need to raise capital through equity or incur higher debt costs
as it would not be as well capitalised as its parent-co. This would in turn dilute returns and weaken
flexibility. By keeping the business within the group structure, OSK can efficiently channel capital to
high-growth business segments, optimise financing costs and accelerate capacity expansion at a
pace that maximises shareholder value.
Cyclical risks make listing less attractive. While the idea of listing the cable business may appear
attractive today, particularly as the industry is enjoying a strong multi-year upcycle, we must also
recognise that the cable sector is inherently cyclical. The current demand surge, driven by data
centres, electrification and infrastructure building, will eventually normalise. When the cycle turns,
a separately listed cable company would be exposed to earnings volatility, margin compression,
and potentially weaker access to funding. Public markets tend to penalise cyclical earnings swings,
leading to share price instability and a higher cost of capital during down cycles.
Stronger resilience under OSK group structure. Under OSK’s group structure, however, the
cable business benefits from financial stability, diversified earnings support and lower funding costs.
The parent’s strong balance sheet and centralised treasury allow the cable division to weather
downturns more effectively. This is strategically advantageous because it enables OSK to take a
long-term view on capacity expansion rather than being constrained by the quarterly earnings
pressure that a standalone listed entity would face. In essence, although listing the cable segment
might unlock short-term valuation gains during the current super cycle, remaining within OSK
provides superior long-term resilience, ensures smoother capital allocation across cycles, and
allows the business to compound value more sustainably over time.

Property
Slower sales momentum in several projects. The group experienced slower property sales in
9M25, recording RM666m and achieving only 66.6% of its full-year sales target of RM1bn. The
primary drag came from a few projects, particularly Iringan Bayu Seremban township and Nara @
Puchong. At Iringan Bayu, several of the more recent launches were double-storey terrace units,
leading to a concentration of similar products in the market. The increased supply in the same
segment naturally moderated demand and led to a slower take-up rate. Meanwhile, Nara @
Puchong is the third phase of the broader Shorea Park development. As earlier phases have
already absorbed a large portion of interested buyers, the pool of pent-up demand has tapered,
causing the subsequent phase to see a more moderated sales pace. This is typical of multi-phase
developments where initial launches benefit from stronger excitement and accumulated demand,
while later phases experience a more gradual absorption. Against this backdrop, we expect the
group is likely to fall short of its RM1bn full-year sales target.
Strengthening marketing execution and strategy. OSK also acknowledged that internal
marketing execution played a role in the softer sales performance. To address this, the group is
taking concrete steps to strengthen its sales and marketing capabilities, including appointing a new
head of sales and marketing and expanding its internal marketing team. A stronger in-house team
not only enhances execution quality but also ensures that the right messaging and value
propositions are consistently communicated to the market, which is an important factor in driving
conversion. In parallel, OSK is refining its product strategy. Learnings from the recent slowdown in
double-storey terrace launches at Iringan Bayu have reinforced the importance of maintaining a
balanced and diversified product mix that matches evolving buyer preferences and avoids over-
concentration in any one segment. Moving forward, the group intends to incorporate these insights
into upcoming launches to better align supply with demand. With more targeted marketing, clearer
project positioning and a more calibrated product pipeline, we believe OSK is positioning itself for
a healthier and more sustained sales recovery heading into FY26.
Australia continues to deliver strong momentum. Australia, on the other hand, continues to
perform well. The second phase of the Melbourne Square development — BLVD — has achieved
a healthy take-up rate of 76% as at 30 Sep 2025. Construction progress is now slightly ahead of
schedule, with earnings expected to be recognised in several phases. We anticipate initial but
marginal contributions in end-FY26 (<10%), followed by the bulk of earnings in FY27 (60–70%),
with the remaining 20–30% flowing through in FY28. Encouraged by the strong response to BLVD,
the group is now preparing to launch the third phase, targeted for post–Chinese New Year 2026.
The upcoming phase has an estimated GDV of around AUD800m (effective GDV: AUD320m). The
sequential phasing, coupled with healthy demand, positions the Australia segment to remain a
meaningful earnings contributor over the medium term.
Atria Mall rejuvenation through strategic tenant mix. The group’s Atria Mall (NLA: 461k sqft)
continues to show encouraging signs of improvement in both occupancy and rental rates. In Sep
2024, the group announced a strategic partnership with PeopleUp, a leading multi-enrichment and
play operator from Singapore. Through this collaboration, Atria Mall will introduce a dedicated
family-oriented entertainment hub designed to cater to children and parents, creating a one-stop
destination for learning, play and holistic family experiences. PeopleUp will occupy approximately
110k sqft, representing ~24% of the mall’s NLA. Renovation works are currently underway, with
operations expected to commence progressively from end-2025. Given the intense competition
among neighbourhood malls in the surrounding area, establishing a differentiated, family-centric
offering could enhance Atria Mall’s positioning, draw consistent footfall and support a broader
rejuvenation of the asset over time.
RHB
Strong earnings momentum supports re-rating. RHB recently delivered a record quarterly net
profit of RM904m in 3Q25 (+8.5% YoY), driven primarily by lower credit costs and stable operating
trends. Following the strong results, the share price has re-rated meaningfully, rising by +7.3% since
the results announcement. If RHB can demonstrate sustained earnings strength in the coming
quarters, particularly continued credit-cost discipline, there remains room for the share price to re-
rate further.

OSK Holdings l Company Update
Meaningful value accretion to OSK. OSK’s 10.27% equity stake in RHB provides substantial
embedded value. Every 7 sen increase in RHB’s share price translates to roughly 1 sen per share
uplift in OSK’s underlying value. Additionally, stronger profitability at RHB should lead to higher
dividend income for OSK, enhancing cash flow to OSK and supporting expansion across its growing
business segments. Notably, OSK’s stake in RHB alone accounts for 75.4% of OSK’s current
market cap, indicating that the market continues to undervalue OSK’s other growing business
segments.
Potential monetisation as valuation improves? Since the RHB–OSK merger, OSK has never
sold any portion of its RHB stake. However, should RHB re-rate to a more demanding valuation, for
instance, trading at a meaningful premium to book value, we do not rule out the possibility of OSK
monetising a small portion of its stake. This option becomes more relevant considering OSK’s net
gearing of 52.5% and the significant expansion opportunities within its own portfolio that may require
additional capital deployment. As an illustration, if RHB re-rates to 1.1x of its current book value to
a price of RM8.48, OSK trimming its stake by 100bps (from 10.27% to 9.27%) could unlock a
substantial RM369.9m of capital. Beyond strengthening internal liquidity, such a move would also
serve as a market validation mechanism, signalling the realisable value of its RHB stake and
potentially narrowing the gap between OSK’s sum-of-parts value and its current market valuation.
A mispriced conglomerate
We believe the market is not assigning OSK a fair valuation. At current levels, the stock trades at a
steep 50% discount to our estimated SOP valuation. Such a wide conglomerate discount would
normally imply weak capital allocation or a lack of strategic direction. However, this assumption
could not be further from the truth. Since 2017, under the new leadership of Mr Ong Ju Yan (Group
MD) and Mr Ong Ju Xing (Deputy Group MD), OSK has demonstrated a consistent and disciplined
track record of sound capital allocation, operational foresight and strong business execution.
Proven capital allocation: divesting weak assets, scaling high-conviction businesses
In the early years of their stewardship, management made decisive moves to streamline the group’s
portfolio by divesting underperforming hotel assets, reducing the portfolio from 13 hotels to just five.
This sharpened the group’s focus and freed up capital for higher-return opportunities.
At the same time, OSK exhibited strong foresight in identifying private credit as a long-term growth
engine. What began as a modest corporate-lending operation has since scaled into a diversified
private credit platform that is now on track to become the largest earnings contributor among its
own business segments. These decisions reflect not only prudent capital allocation but also an
ability to anticipate structural industry shifts ahead of the market.
More recently, the group has made two strategic acquisitions that we believe again demonstrate
foresight and are long-term value accretive:
1. The acquisition of Universal Cable’s assets, which immediately doubled OSK’s
production capacity and positioned the group as the one of the largest cable producers in
Malaysia to ride on the industry super cycle.
2. The acquisition of Wilayah Credit, which opens a scalable entry into the motor financing
segment, a structurally growing niche supported by the gig economy and upcoming
regulatory tailwinds from the Consumer Credit Act.
Both acquisitions demonstrate the group’s ability to deploy capital into businesses with strong
growth runways, favourable industry dynamics and synergistic fit within the OSK ecosystem.
Execution strength not reflected in share price yet
In our view, the market’s wide discount fails to recognise OSK’s high-quality leadership, disciplined
capital allocation and growing portfolio of scalable, high-return businesses. The group has
repeatedly demonstrated the ability to exit low-return segments, invest in structurally attractive ones
and execute with prudence and foresight. As OSK’s private credit, cables and property segments
continue to scale and as the market develops better appreciation towards OSK’s execution
capabilities, we believe the valuation gap should narrow meaningfully.

OSK Holdings l Company Update
The current share price hence offers investors an opportunity to own a well-managed, deeply
undervalued conglomerate where multiple businesses are approaching inflection points, none of
which are fully priced in today.
Valuation
We are recalibrating our valuation to reflect the following changes:
Private credit: For the private credit segment, we raise our PE multiple from 16x to 18x, pegged to
FY26 EPS. This reflects (i) strong structural tailwinds from civil servant financing and motor
financing, as well as (ii) improving earnings visibility as more products/markets move beyond the
incubation phase. Even after the upgrade, our multiple remains conservative relative to global
private credit managers such as Qualitas, which trade at 25.3x PER on FY26 EPS.
Industries: For the Industries division, we lift our PE multiple from 12x to 16x, also pegged to FY26
EPS. This better captures the step-change in earnings potential following the Universal Cable asset
acquisition, which doubled cable capacity and positioned OSK as one of the largest cable producers
in Malaysia at the onset of an industry super cycle. Our revised multiple is still below its closest peer
SCG, which trades at 17.2x FY26 PER. While SCG is already operating near full utilisation, with
further upside relying mainly on incremental capacity and mix upgrade via higher-margin US
exports, OSK’s cable segment is at a much earlier stage of its growth curve. OSK is still ramping
up JB utilisation, progressing HV certification and pushing deeper into exports, implying a stronger
medium-term earnings CAGR than SCG. On that basis, OSK’s cable business arguably deserves
to trade at a premium multiple to SCG, not a discount. Our valuation thus remains conservative.
Narrowing the conglomerate discount: Finally, we narrow our SOP discount from 20% to 15%.
We believe the market should not be ascribing such a wide conglomerate discount to OSK, given
its proven capital-allocation discipline and improving line-of-sight on growth across multiple
segments.
Following these adjustments, we revise our TP upwards to RM2.40 from RM2.13. Even at this
higher TP, our valuation remains conservative, as it implies undemanding FY25/26/27 PERs of
12.9x/12.3x/10.8x.
Forecast. Unchanged.
Maintain our conviction BUY with a higher TP of RM2.40, based on a 15% discount to our
revised SOP-derived valuation of RM2.82. The current share price offers investors an opportunity
to own a well-managed, deeply undervalued conglomerate where multiple businesses are
approaching inflection points, none of which are fully priced in today. Notably, OSK’s stake in RHB
alone accounts for 75.4% of its market cap, suggesting the market is undervaluing its other growing
businesses. The stock also provides a good projected FY25 dividend yield of 4.2%.
