System loan growth eased to +5.2% YoY in Nov-25, though lending momentum
stayed resilient, supported by stronger leading indicators with loan applications
OVERWEIGHT
surging (+11.7% YoY) and approvals rising (+9.2% YoY). In contrast, deposits
growth slowed to +2.7% YoY, dragged by softer CASA and foreign currency
(Maintained)
inflows. Interest spread saw a modest uptick of 1bp to 2.39%, but NIM pressures
KLFIN are expected to linger into 4Q25 until elevated deposit costs begin to normalise.
With valuations already buoyed by recent price performance, we rerate some of
the coverages to UNDER REVIEW from BUY call. However, OVERWEIGHT rating
is reiterated on the sector for now, pending potential TP upgrades in the
upcoming sector report.
Nov’s loans growth eased to +5.2% YoY (Oct: +5.4%), weighed down by softer
business (Biz; +5.0% vs Oct: +5.5%) segment, while household (HH; +5.4% vs Oct:
+5.4%) held steady. The slowdown in Biz dragged mainly by weaker SME lending
albeit non-SME’s investment borrowing increased, whereas HH growth was supported
by property and auto financing. Overall, system loan growth continued to track stably,
staying comfortably within our FY25 forecast range of 5.0%–5.5%.
Stock Rating
Leading indicators rebounded strongly, with loan applications jumping +11.7%
Stock Rating Price Target
Affin BUY 2.35 3.00 YoY (Oct: -2.0%) and approvals rising +9.2% YoY (Oct: -2.3%). By segment, Biz
UNDER 5.05 5.10 applications recorded a sharp turnaround (+21.9% vs Oct: -8.5%), while HH growth
Alliance
REVIEW eased (+2.8% vs Oct: +4.4%). Meanwhile, banks demonstrated a stronger lending
AMMB UNDER 6.50 6.20 appetite, as Biz approvals surged to +13.0% YoY (Oct: -8.4%).
REVIEW
BIMB HOLD 2.29 2.30
Deposits growth moderated to +2.7% YoY (Oct: +3.7%), weighed down by weaker
UNDER 8.25 8.80
CIMB REVIEW CASA and foreign currency deposits. Meanwhile, Nov-25’s loan-to-deposit ratio
UNDER 10.48 10.70 inched higher MoM, reaching a new 5-year high of 90.0%. Looking ahead, we expect
Maybank
REVIEW the ratio to ease as FD competition typically intensifies in the final month of the year.
Public BUY 4.54 5.10
UNDER 7.71 7.70
RHB Stable asset quality. Nov-25’s GIL ratio held broadly stable at 1.40% (Oct: 1.39%),
REVIEW
with both HH and Biz segments ticking up marginally by 1bp each. Looking ahead,
asset quality is expected to remain steady, supported by resilient economic
conditions. We are not overly concerned about potential deterioration, as banks are
well-positioned with ample overlay balances and sizeable impaired loan provisions
accumulated over the past five years, providing a buffer against any uptick in the GIL
ratio.
Interest spread inched up by 1bp MoM to 2.39%, reflecting continued repricing of
3-month board FD rates in 4Q25, even as average lending yields softened following
July’s OPR cut. With funding costs typically taking 6–9 months to fully reprice, and FD
competition intensifying through 4Q25, margin pressures will likely persist, keeping
NIM under sustained near-term pressure.
Maintain OVERWEIGHT for now. In light of the recent strength in the sector, we take
the opportunity to rerate some of our coverage from BUY to UNDER REVIEW, given
limited upside against our current target prices. This applies to Alliance, AMMB,
CIMB, Maybank and RHB. Accordingly, we reiterate our OVERWEIGHT rating on the
sector for now, pending a review on the target prices for our coverage in the upcoming
sector report.
