provides aluminium ingots, billets, fluorocarbon, and We recently hosted a meeting with PMETAL’s founder/Group CEO, Tan Sri Dato
other products. Koon Poh Keong and Deputy CEO, Ooi Beng Guan, and felt upbeat with PMETAL’s
outlook going forward. Below are the key takeaways from the meeting.
Share price
Aluminium deficit likely to persist in FY26f. LME aluminium prices have
strengthened to USD2,800/MT level, the highest level since 2022, driven by a
tightening supply backdrop which is expected to remain through 2026. By Sept 2025,
China's aluminium production capacity had risen to around 45.84m MT, with 44.06m
MT in active operation (link). This led Chinese players to expand new capacity in
Indonesia. However, we gather that Indonesia’s smelting expansion continues to face
structural constraints, due to limited power availability which has delayed
commissioning timelines (link). With this, we believe aluminium prices will be
supported at USD2,800-2,900/MT throughout FY26f.

in Europe benefited from higher aluminium premiums.

Press Metal Aluminium l Company Update
India remains the bright spot for solar extrusion products. India remains one of
PMETAL’s core export markets for solar extrusion products, supported by strong
structural demand and the country’s continued reliance on imported solar frames.
Despite this, PMETAL has no intention of establishing manufacturing operations in
India, citing a significant gap in efficiency and product quality relative to its existing
operations. Imported products, particularly from China, remain more cost-competitive
than domestic production in India, reducing the commercial viability of local
expansion at this stage.
USD/MYR Impact. PMETAL hedges up to 30% of its USD exposure, primarily
relating to electricity costs. While alumina (typically accounts for c.30% of total cost)
is also denominated in USD, this provides a natural hedge against currency
fluctuations. Based on our model sensitivity analysis, every 10 sen movement in
USD/MYR is estimated to impact group earnings by approx. 5%.
Forecast. We revised our FY25f-27f earnings forecast by +8.5%/+15.7%/+2.2% as
we raised our LME aluminium price forecasts to USD2,625–2,750/MT (from
USD2,550-2,650/MT previously), reflecting sustained supply tightness. Alumina cost
assumptions have been revised downward to USD400-410/MT (from USD450/MT
previously) to account for a widening global surplus. We have also updated our
USD/MYR assumption to mirror our in-house view.

Maintain BUY, TP: RM7.64. We maintain our BUY call on PMETAL with a higher TP
of RM7.64 (from RM7.11), based on its 5-year historical mean PE multiple of 25x on
FY26f EPS. We expect aluminium prices to remain resilient, underpinned by
persistent supply tightness, while easing alumina input costs provide an incremental
tailwind to margin expansion. Overall, we like PMETAL due to (i) its favourable cost
structure as the bulk of its energy costs are locked in via long-term PPA; (ii) solid
track record as an investible aluminium proxy in Malaysia; and (iii) favourable ESG
profile as its smelters are hydro-powered.

Press Metal Aluminium l Company Update
Press Metal’s ESG Snapshot
F4GBM Index member : Yes The goal of this section is to provide an overview of Press Metal’s ESG trends and developments. The information
FTSE Russell ESG rating :  presented here is from the financial year FY24 and will be updated as new data becomes available. Overall, we find the
group has no glaring ESG issues.
MSCI ESG rating : AA
Environmental (E) indicators
 Introduced low-carbon aluminium brand, GEMTM, which is produced with a carbon footprint of less than 4.0 MT of CO2 e per MT of aluminium for Scope 1 (direct)
and Scope 2 (indirect) GHG emissions.
 Reduced 16.3% in direct and indirect GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) in FY24 as compared to baseline 2020.
 Aiming to achieve a 15% reduction in GHG emissions by 2025; a 30% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030; and carbon neutrality by 2050 (based on FY20 baseline).
 Expanded renewable energy capacity by acquiring an additional 1.2 MW of solar power capacity at PMBA Nilai 2, bringing total solar energy capacity to 14.7 MW.
 GHG emission intensity stood at 8.6 tCO2 e/tonne, 1.2% less than FY23.
 Intensity of energy consumption was at 52.8m GJ/tonne of aluminium (vs FY23: 55.6 GJ/tonne of aluminium).
 Reported water consumption intensity per revenue of 2.5 m3/tonne of aluminium (vs FY23: 2.3 m3/tonne of aluminium).
 Aiming to achieve a 95% waste recycling by 2026; zero waste sent to landfill by 2030.
 Achieved 20.2% water withdrawal reduction in FY24 and aiming for 10% reduction by 2030 (based on FY16 baseline).
 6,100 tonnes of GHG emissions were avoided through solar energy use in FY24.
 Recovered 15,682 tonnes of post-consumer aluminium scrap, thus potentially avoiding 203,141 tonnes of GHG emissions in FY21.
 E-waste recycling programme successfully diverted 460 kg of discarded electrical items from disposal in FY24.
Comments: Based on our observation, all indicators appeared to be reasonable.
Social (S) indicators
 Employee turnover rate remains unchanged from 14.2% vs FY23.
 Composition of female Board of Directors stood at 33.6% (vs FY20: 30.5%).
 The average training hours per employee was at 50.5 hours (vs FY23: 46.8 hours).
Comments: Press Metal improved its average training hours per employee and successfully maintained a low turnover rate. From our observation, the group’s gender
equality focus has also improved with more females in the managerial positions.
Governance (G) indicators
 Board size of 10 directors (vs FY23: 10 directors) where 50% were independent (vs FY23: 50%). Meeting attendance was 100% (vs FY23: 100%).
 Independent directors form 100% / 100% / 100% of audit / risk / nomination & remuneration committee (vs FY23: 100% / 100% / 100%).
 The percentage of executive & non-executive directors' pay to total core net income stood at 0.75% (vs FY23:1.0%).
Comments: Given the size of Press Metal, it is only natural to see a larger number of directors serving its Board. Separately, we deem that there were no issues with the
directors’ independence. Also, the compensation package for executive & non-executive directors appeared to be somewhat reasonable.
