Trader Brief
Technical view: Pending a triangle breakout
Despite near-term choppiness, we remain constructive on the KLCI’s prospects, with the
index poised for a bullish triangle breakout, reinforced by the historically stronger
seasonality in Dec. A sustained close above the immediate hurdles at the 1,622/20-day
MA and 1,643 (downtrend line) would pave the way for a retest of the YTD peak at 1,659.
On the flip side, failure to clear these hurdles could witness the index to trap in a triangle
consolidate, with key support levels anchored at 1,600 and 1,590/100-day MA.
Daily KLCI: Temporarily locked in triangle breakout
