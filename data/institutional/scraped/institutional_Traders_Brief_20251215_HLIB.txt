Dec MTD 3.55 2.50
2025 YTD 3.17 2.57
Sources: HLIB, Bursa We remain sanguine of a potential LT downtrend line breakout (from all-time high 1,897
in Apr 2018) on the KLCI, which continues to ride above its support trendline and above
20D MA/ 1,619, amid expectations of strong December seasonality and continued Fed-
cut optimism coupled with RM strength. A decisive breakout above 1,641 (downtrend line)
would open the door for a further advance toward 1,659 (52-week high) and 1,686 (110%
FE) levels. Failure to clear this hurdle may keep the index in consolidation, with support
seen at 1,600 (trendline).
