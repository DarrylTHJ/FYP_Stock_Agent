Products and services portfolio. As the leading eye specialist services provider in Malaysia,
Optimax provides an extensive range of ophthalmic services, which can be separated into four main
categories:
(a) Treatments of eye diseases/disorders. Optimax undertakes a variety of treatment for eye
diseases and disorders. This category mainly contributed by cataract surgeries, followed by
treatment and management of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinal
detachment, glaucoma, and others surgery of other eye diseases.
Cataract is the clouding of the natural lens of the eye, most commonly caused by aging. Patients
with cataract may experience symptoms such as blurred and/or cloudy vision, seeing faded
colours, and/or poor vision in the dark. If left untreated, cataract may lead to loss of vision.
Hence, cataract surgery is required to remove the clouded natural lens and replace it with an
artificial lens known as an intraocular lens (IOLs).
Typically, there are 2 cataract treatments offered by Optimax namely, phacoemulsification
(PHACO) and femtosecond laser (a bladeless procedure). For PHACO, which involves the use
a blade to make a micro incision on the cornea and break up the cataract into smaller pieces
for removal with the use of high-frequency ultrasound (Figure #3). Alternatively, the
femtosecond laser procedure employs advanced laser technology to create precise corneal
incisions and fragment the cataract, reducing reliance on manual blades. This technique
enhances surgical precision and safety, thereby lowering the risk of post-operative
complications (Figure #4). Despite its clinical advantages, femtosecond laser surgery requires
longer operating time (ie. additional 15 mins/eye) and incurs higher costs (ie. additional
c.RM2,500/eye). As a result, PHACO remains the predominant option for patients, while
Optimax currently operates a single femtosecond laser machine, located at its Sri Petaling
branch.

For IOLs, there are multiple type that Optimax offer such as monofocal lens, monofocal toric
lens, multifocal lens, and multifocal toric lens. Notably, monofocal lens have one focusing
distance – which means that the lens can only be set for either close or distance vision.
Multifocal lenses have multiple focusing distances and thus can be set for close and distance
vision. Toric lens is designed to be used by patients with astigmatism. In terms of pricing,
multifocal lens is typically more expensive than monofocal lens, while toric lens is more
expensive than non-toric lens.
This segment contributed 45%-50% of 2024 and 1H2025 revenues, specifically, cataract
surgeries contributed majority of this segment i.e. 80%-90% of the segmental revenue in 2024
and 1H2025.
(b) Refractive surgeries. Refractive surgeries are elective surgeries used to correct refractive
errors that cause vision impairment, including short-sightedness (myopia), long-sightedness
(hyperopia), astigmatism (imperfection in the curvature of the eye that causes blurred vision),
and age-related presbyopia, and thus reduce patients’ need for eyewear and/or contact lenses.
Notably, Optimax is regarded as among the pioneers of laser vision correction in Malaysia,
initially performing Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA) or Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK)
procedures among its earliest patients back in 1995.
The two categories of refractive surgery offered by Optimax are laser vision correction and
implantable contact lens treatment (ICL). In laser vision correction, the general idea is to change
the shape of the cornea. Once the overall shape of the cornea is altered, the prescription/power
of the eye can be changed. At Optimax, a wide range of laser vision correction methods are
available: ZEISS SMILE Pro, ReLEx SMILE, Customised Femto-Lasik, Advanced Surface
Ablation (ASA), Trans-Epithelial Surface Ablation (TESA), and PRESBYOND.
The ICL is a specially designed soft and flexible lens that is implanted in the eye (between the
iris and the crystalline lens) to give you clear vision (Figure #5). It is made out of collamer, a
5 HLIB Research l www.hlebroking.com
Optimax Holdings l Initiating Coverage
material that is biocompatible with the eye, making it a highly popular surgical option for those
seeking an alternative to laser vision correction procedures.
Remarkably, laser vision correction and ICL suitability screening is now claimable under
Prudential medical cards since 2Q2025, supporting patient affordability and encouraging early
stage engagement with our specialist services.
This segment contributed 45%-50% of 2024 and 1H2025 revenues, specifically, ZEISS SMILE
Pro and ReLEx SMILE contributed majority of this segment i.e. above 80% of the segmental
revenue in 2024 and 1H2025.
Figure #5 An illustration of the implantable contact lens treatment (ICL)
Source: Company’s website
(c) Consultation and dispensary services. At Optimax, all patients are required to undergo
consultations on their first visit. The two types of consultations practiced at Optimax are the pre-
operative and post-operative consultations. During a pre-operative consultation, surgeons
discuss patients’ eye condition and possible treatments to be performed. The post-operative
consultation is a follow-up by the surgeon to evaluate and monitor patients’ healing process.
This segment contributed c.5% of 2024 and YTD-25 revenues.
(d) Oculoplastic surgeries. Oculoplastic surgery is a specialised area of ophthalmology which
focuses on the health of the eyelids, orbit, tear ducts and other structures around the eye. This
primarily involves procedures on the eyelids and eye bags for functional and cosmetic
purposes. Functional oculoplastic surgery involves repairing the areas that cause visual
impairment such as congenital defects and abnormal eyelid positioning. Cosmetic/aesthetic
surgery enhances appearance by reconstructing features around the eyes such as lifting of the
eyelids. This segment contributed less than 5% of 2024 and YTD-25 revenues.
Figure #6 An illustration of eyelids surgeries
Source: Company
Additionally, the Group extends its services to encompass a range of other eye-related offerings,
such as eye examination and sales of optical wear, food products, plastic surgery and aesthetic
services, as well as others.
For food products, Optimax markets its own brand of food products under the brand of
“OptixanthinTM”, which contains astaxanthin, a naturally-occurring colour pigment referred to as
carotenoid derived from microalgae, that is mixed with unrefined coconut oil. These products are
6 HLIB Research l www.hlebroking.com
Optimax Holdings l Initiating Coverage
intended to be complementary to its business where they are marketed as antioxidant food products
for the general wellbeing of an individual.
For plastic surgery and aesthetic services, Optimax leveraged on its existing oculoplastic surgery
know-how. In 2023, the Group acquired a license from the Ministry of Health (MoH) for plastic
surgery and aesthetic services, marking a strategic expansion of its suite of services in its service
portfolio. Optimax’s plastic surgery and aesthetic services are currently operating in Ipoh ACC and
is extending its aesthetic business to the new ACC at Atria Mall, Damansara Jaya operational in
3Q2024. This segment contributed less than 1% of 2024 and YTD-25 revenues.
Investment Highlights
Poised to capitalise on the fast growing medical eye care industry
According to Protégé Associates, the industry revenue in Malaysia is forecasted to expand from
RM850m in 2024 to RM1.2bn by 2028 (or at a CAGR of 10.1%) (Figure #7). We believe this growth
trend will be well supported by a number of structural trends that is currently happening in Malaysia,
including: (i) still growing but aging population profile, (ii) prevalence of lifestyle diseases/disorders,
(iii) growing affluence among Malaysians, (iv) increasing penetration into Malaysians via expansion
plans, (v) increasing prevalence of myopia and raising awareness of the disadvantages of wearing
contact lens, as well as (vi) a favourable outlook on medical tourism. With nearly 30 years of
operating track record and widespread locations in Malaysia (15 ACCs, one hospital, and eight
satellite clinics in various states of Malaysia), we believe Optimax is well-positioned to capitalise on
this structural growth trajectory.
Looking at the recent trends, Malaysia’s medical eye care industry revenue expanded from
RM543m in 2021 to RM702m in 2022 (29.4% YoY), mainly driven by the surge in domestic patients’
demand for medical eye care services after prior years of delays attributed to the various Covid-19
induced movement control orders (MCOs), together with the reopening of international borders
which allowed for the recovery of health tourists.
Following a strong 2022, the industry growth moderated to 10.4% YoY in 2023, reaching RM776m,
as a decline in cataract surgeries was offset by growth in refractive surgeries, which generated
higher revenue per eye, based on our research. For 2024, industry revenue is forecasted to rise by
9.5% YoY to RM850m in 2024, mainly supported by the increasing adoption more advanced
refractive technologies such as ZEISS SMILE Pro.
Going into 2025, we believe the 9.5% YoY industry growth to be primarily driven by volume
expansion, in line with Optimax’s guidance of improving demand in both cataract and refractive
surgeries from 3Q 2025 onwards. This momentum is further supported by the recent recruitment of
an ophthalmologist in Sep 2025 at the Johor Bahru ACC and the onboarding of Prudential as a
panel insurer since 2Q2025

Entering into the asset-milking stage – margin upcycle and deleveraging
Entering into the asset milking stage. From 3Q2022 to 3Q2024, Optimax embarked on an
aggressive expansion phase, opening eight satellite clinics and four ACCs. This drove a rise in pre-
operating setup costs, which included: the early recruitment of doctors, nurses, optometrists, and
support staff ahead of operations, higher depreciation and lease payments on right-of-use assets,
consultancy and professional fees tied to the Cambodian ACC, as well as increased marketing
expenses to support the rollout of new ACCs and an aesthetic clinic in newly penetrated areas.
As a regulatory requirement, Optimax must appoint at least one doctor before applying to the MoH
Malaysia for approval to operate an ACC, satellite clinic, or hospital. Given the approval process is
often uncertain and can take up to a year, this has proven to be margin dilutive. Notably, front-
loaded setup costs amounted to c.RM3m in 2024, of which c.80% was attributed to doctors’ front-
loading fees.
Given the nature of operating costs are typically front-loaded while revenue ramp-up is back-loaded,
this expansion phase resulted in declining profit margins (Figure #9) and a weakening balance
sheet (Figure #10) since 3Q2022. From 4Q2024, Optimax has transitioned into the asset-milking
stage – a phase typically characterised by a profit margin upcycle through economies of scale and
progressive deleveraging, thereby strengthening the Group’s overall balance sheet profile. We

Pipeline expansions are not expected to significantly impact margins. In 2026, the Group has
guided the addition of a single ACC – a 70%-owned facility in Indonesia – scheduled to begin
operations by 3Q2026. Unlike the Malaysian expansion wave during 3Q2022-3Q2024, front-loaded
setup costs are expected to be minimal. This is because the centre will replicate the Cambodian
operating model: instead of hiring new resident doctors and undergoing a separate approval
process with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, Optimax will leverage its existing
pool of Malaysian doctors to obtain approvals and conduct surgeries on a rotational basis (ie. one
doctor visit per month, with a maximum of two doctors on a bi-weekly basis).
Looking ahead to 2027, Optimax plans to launch two additional facilities: (i) an ACC at SELGATE
Hospital, Setia Alam, and (ii) a comprehensive eye specialist centre at the Eye Hospital in Kempas,
Johor. For both projects, the respective hospital operators will assume responsibility for obtaining
the necessary approvals from the MoH. This structure significantly reduces Optimax’s exposure to
upfront doctor recruitment costs – the largest component of pre-operating expenses – allowing the
Group to expand with minimal margin dilution.

A good candidate for upcoming Thematic Plays in 2026 and 2027
Thematic play 2026: Malaysia Year of Medical Tourism
Robust medical tourism revenue in Malaysia. According to the Malaysia Healthcare Travel
Council (MHTC), total revenue from healthcare travellers in Malaysia recorded a healthy CAGR
15% between 2011 and 2019, before declining substantially by 64.1% to RM0.60bn in 2021 due to
Covid-related lockdowns. The sector rebounded strongly in 2022 with a 117% surge, fuelled by
pent-up demand, followed by sustained growth of 73% YoY in 2023 and 21% YoY in 2024, mainly
underpinned by increasing recognition of Malaysia’s more competitive regional pricing and its strong
reputation for quality services. Notably, 2023 medical tourism revenue of RM2.25bn exceeded the
pre-pandemic peak RM1.67bn in 2019 (Figure #11).
Going into 2025, MHTC projects 10% YoY growth to RM3.0bn. In a longer term, revenue is
expected to gradually reach RM5.0bn by 2030 (or a CAGR of 11%).
According to MHTC, Indonesia was the highest contributor of health tourists to Malaysia, comprising
70-80% in 2023. Malaysia’s international standing in the sector was further reinforced in May 2025,
when it was ranked number one among the world’s top 10 medical tourism destinations by Dubai-
based wealth consultancy firm Nomad Capitalist, higher than regional peers such as Singapore (#2)
and Thailand (#3). The ranking highlighted Malaysia’s high-quality healthcare facilities and medical
expertise, competitive treatment costs, and the widespread use of English, which enhances
accessibility compared with destinations like Thailand.

MYMT 2026. On 24 Jul 2025, the government officially launched the Malaysia Year of Medical
Tourism (MYMT) 2026. This campaign seeks to attract more international healthcare travellers by
highlighting the country’s high-quality, affordable medical services. To further amplify its reach,
celebrated singer Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza (who has a large following in Indonesia, based on our
channel checks) was appointed as the official ambassador. Hence, we believe the government will
soon announce incremental upside through allocations for the MYMT 2026, particularly in area such
as promotion, infrastructure, and connectivity, which would help drive stronger health tourist inflows,
benefitting Optimax.
Ophthalmology highly sought-after by healthcare travellers. In Malaysia, medical tourism has
the potential to contribute to the demand for medical eye care services meaningfully in the future,
as ophthalmology services are one of the 11 most commonly sought-after treatment for healthcare
travellers in Malaysia (Figure #12). This is mainly attributed high-quality patient care in Malaysia at
a substantially lower cost compared to many western countries, as well as SEA peers (Figure #13).
Although healthcare travellers accounted for only 10% of Optimax’s 2024 revenue, we believe this
has room to grow in during MYMT 2026, underpinned by its reputable brand-name and high quality
services.

Thematic play in 2027: Johor’s next consumption wave
About RTS Link. According to news reports, the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System
(RTS) Link is scheduled to begin operations by Dec 2026. Spanning 4 kilometres, the link will
connect Bukit Chagar in Johor Bahru to Woodlands North in Singapore. The RTS Link is expected
to cut travel time between Johor Bahru and Singapore to just 6 minutes, compared to more than 1-
2 hours during peak periods via the Johor–Singapore Causeway. Besides, the RTS Link is designed
to carry about 10k passengers per hour per direction, or up to 30k commuters during peak hours.
All in, the RTS Link is positioned as a catalyst for smoother cross-border commutes, stronger
bilateral ties, and revitalised economic momentum in Johor Bahru.
Johor’s next consumption wave. Based on our view, the first wave of beneficiaries in Malaysia
from the RTS Link was residential properties near RTS Bukit Chagar where early buyers positioned
ahead of the system’s opening and already enjoyed a visible uplift in property values. In contrast,
for retail, F&B, hospitality and healthcare services, such early positioning is not possible as
consumers cannot “buy ahead” of the RTS. For ophthalmology day-care services, we expect the
true business flow impact will materialise only once the RTS becomes operational and daily cross-
border traffic ramps up, setting the stage for Optimax to emerge as the next play in the Johor growth
story. Between 2022–2024, the Johor region contributed approximately 20% of Group revenue, with
the Johor Bahru ACC alone accounting for 40% of this contribution – a centre we believe is best
positioned to capture incremental demand from healthcare travellers once the RTS commences
operations.
Unlike cataract surgeries, refractive surgeries in Singapore are considered elective surgeries, and
therefore not covered under MediShield Life (the mandatory national basic health insurance for
Singapore citizens and PRs) and nor claimable via MediSave (mandatory national medical savings
11 HLIB Research l www.hlebroking.com
Optimax Holdings l Initiating Coverage
account), except in specific cases (i.e. there is a difference of at least 300 degrees in power between
your eyes and if you are intolerant to prescription glasses and contact lenses). Consequently,
Malaysia’s cost advantage (Figure #13), coupled with shorter travel time via the RTS Link, could
serve as a key draw for Singaporeans seeking refractive surgeries across the border.
Eye Hospital in Kempas poised to benefit. To further capture growth from the upcoming RTS
Link, Optimax is set to commence operations at its comprehensive eye specialist centre within the
Eye Hospital in Kempas, Johor (Figure #14). To recap, Optimax signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) with Sena Resources and Kempas Eye Specialist Hospital for the
development of a purpose-built private eye hospital on land owned by Sena. Under the agreement,
Sena Resources will bear the construction cost, while Optimax will lease the land and hospital upon
completion. Given the close proximity of the planned Kempas hospital to the upcoming RTS Link
station in Bukit Chagar, Johor (c.25-minute drive apart), we expect good patient volumes for the
hospital.

Financials
Historical performance. Throughout FY22-24, Optimax recorded a decent revenue growth from
RM108.0m to RM127.7m, or a CAGR of 8.7% (Figure #15). In FY23, the 5.5% YoY growth was
primarily supported by stronger demand for refractive surgeries, which command higher revenue
per eye, thereby offsetting a decline in cataract procedures. In FY24, the 12.1% YoY growth was
mainly boosted by the increasing adoption more advanced refractive technologies e.g. ZEISS
SMILE Pro, which command a higher revenue per eye.
However, on the bottom line, Optimax’s core PATMI declined at a CAGR of 5.4% in FY22-24, mainly
weighed down by its aggressive expansion phase between 3Q2022 and 3Q2024. During this
period, the Group opened eight satellite clinics and four ACCs, which resulted in elevated pre-
operating setup costs and margin pressure.
Forecast. Going forward, we project Optimax to deliver a 3-year revenue CAGR of 10.0% (2024-
27), aligned with the industry growth rate of 9.8% forecasted by Protégé Associates. In tandem, we
forecast a stronger 3-year core PATMI CAGR of 19.8%, driven primarily by economies of scale as
the Group transitions into the asset-milking stage.
Notably, our 2025-27 core PATMI forecasts are broadly aligned with consensus at this juncture.
However, we see potential upside surprises, particularly from:
(a) Stronger-than-expected revenue growth supported by the MYMT 2026 and incremental patient
inflows driven by the RTS Link in 2027; and
(b) EBITDA margin expansion exceeding our conservative assumptions, as Optimax continues to
unlock operating leverage in the asset-milking stage.
Dividend. Despite Optimax not having a specific dividend policy, the Group has been consistently
paying dividends since FY21. Based on the last three years, the dividend payout ratios were 88.2%,
50.6%, and 54.4% in FY22-24 respectively. Going forward, we assume Optimax will distribute 55%
of annual audited PATMI to shareholders. Based on our earnings projections, coupled with a 55%
12 HLIB Research l www.hlebroking.com
Optimax Holdings l Initiating Coverage
payout ratio, this will translate into cash dividends of RM8.9m, RM10.7m, and RM12.3m in FY25-
27 respectively. At current share price, this implies a decent 2025 dividend yield of 2.4%.

Valuation and Recommendation
We initiate coverage on Optimax with a BUY call and TP of RM0.96 (Figure #16), based on 30x
fully diluted 2026 PE (+1.0 SD above its 3-year mean; Figure #17). We believe the premium multiple
is justified given:
(a) Transition into the asset-milking stage, typically characterised by a profit margin upcycle
through economies of scale and progressive deleveraging, thereby strengthening the Group’s
overall balance sheet profile. We believe this ongoing favourable shift in coming quarters
underpins a compelling case for renewed market interests; and
(b) Strategic positioning in upcoming thematic plays, namely MYMT 2026 and Johor’s next
consumption wave post RTS Link in 2027, which could drive upside earnings surprises to both
our and consensus estimates.
That said, our target multiple is broadly in line with the closest comparable domestically listed
healthcare service provider peers’ average of 29x 2026 PE (Figure #18).
