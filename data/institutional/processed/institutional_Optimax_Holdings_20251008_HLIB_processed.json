            "text": "(a) Treatments of eye diseases/disorders. Optimax undertakes a variety of treatment for eye diseases and disorders. This category mainly contributed by cataract surgeries, followed by treatment and management of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and others surgery of other eye diseases.\nCataract is the clouding of the natural lens of the eye, most commonly caused by aging. Patients with cataract may experience symptoms such as blurred and/or cloudy vision, seeing faded colours, and/or poor vision in the dark. If left untreated, cataract may lead to loss of vision. Hence, cataract surgery is required to remove the clouded natural lens and replace it with an artificial lens known as an intraocular lens (IOLs).\nTypically, there are 2 cataract treatments offered by Optimax namely, phacoemulsification (PHACO) and femtosecond laser (a bladeless procedure). For PHACO, which involves the use a blade to make a micro incision on the cornea and break up the cataract into smaller pieces for removal with the use of high-frequency ultrasound (Figure #3). Alternatively, the femtosecond laser procedure employs advanced laser technology to create precise corneal incisions and fragment the cataract, reducing reliance on manual blades. This technique enhances surgical precision and safety, thereby lowering the risk of post-operative complications (Figure #4). Despite its clinical advantages, femtosecond laser surgery requires longer operating time (ie. additional 15 mins/eye) and incurs higher costs (ie. additional c.RM2,500/eye). As a result, PHACO remains the predominant option for patients, while Optimax currently operates a single femtosecond laser machine, located at its Sri Petaling branch.\nFor IOLs, there are multiple type that Optimax offer such as monofocal lens, monofocal toric lens, multifocal lens, and multifocal toric lens. Notably, monofocal lens have one focusing distance \u2013 which means that the lens can only be set for either close or distance vision. Multifocal lenses have multiple focusing distances and thus can be set for close and distance vision. Toric lens is designed to be used by patients with astigmatism. In terms of pricing, multifocal lens is typically more expensive than monofocal lens, while toric lens is more expensive than non-toric lens.\nThis segment contributed 45%-50% of 2024 and 1H2025 revenues, specifically, cataract surgeries contributed majority of this segment i.e. 80%-90% of the segmental revenue in 2024 and 1H2025.",

            "text": "(b) Refractive surgeries. Refractive surgeries are elective surgeries used to correct refractive errors that cause vision impairment, including short-sightedness (myopia), long-sightedness (hyperopia), astigmatism (imperfection in the curvature of the eye that causes blurred vision), and age-related presbyopia, and thus reduce patients\u2019 need for eyewear and/or contact lenses. Notably, Optimax is regarded as among the pioneers of laser vision correction in Malaysia, initially performing Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA) or Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) procedures among its earliest patients back in 1995.\nThe two categories of refractive surgery offered by Optimax are laser vision correction and implantable contact lens treatment (ICL). In laser vision correction, the general idea is to change the shape of the cornea. Once the overall shape of the cornea is altered, the prescription/power of the eye can be changed. At Optimax, a wide range of laser vision correction methods are available: ZEISS SMILE Pro, ReLEx SMILE, Customised Femto-Lasik, Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA), Trans-Epithelial Surface Ablation (TESA), and PRESBYOND.\nThe ICL is a specially designed soft and flexible lens that is implanted in the eye (between the iris and the crystalline lens) to give you clear vision (Figure #5). It is made out of collamer, a material that is biocompatible with the eye, making it a highly popular surgical option for those seeking an alternative to laser vision correction procedures.\nRemarkably, laser vision correction and ICL suitability screening is now claimable under Prudential medical cards since 2Q2025, supporting patient affordability and encouraging early stage engagement with our specialist services.\nThis segment contributed 45%-50% of 2024 and 1H2025 revenues, specifically, ZEISS SMILE Pro and ReLEx SMILE contributed majority of this segment i.e. above 80% of the segmental revenue in 2024 and 1H2025.",

We believe this growth trend will be well supported by a number of structural trends that is currently happening in Malaysia, including: (i) still growing but aging population profile, (ii) prevalence of lifestyle diseases/disorders, (iii) growing affluence among Malaysians, (iv) increasing penetration into Malaysians via expansion plans, (v) increasing prevalence of myopia and raising awareness of the disadvantages of wearing contact lens, as well as (vi) a favourable outlook on medical tourism. With nearly 30 years of operating track record and widespread locations in Malaysia (15 ACCs, one hospital, and eight satellite clinics in various states of Malaysia), we believe Optimax is well-positioned to capitalise on this structural growth trajectory.\nLooking at the recent trends, Malaysia\u2019s medical eye care industry revenue expanded from RM543m in 2021 to RM702m in 2022 (29.4% YoY), mainly driven by the surge in domestic patients\u2019 demand for medical eye care services after prior years of delays attributed to the various Covid-19 induced movement control orders (MCOs), together with the reopening of international borders which allowed for the recovery of health tourists.\nFollowing a strong 2022, the industry growth moderated to 10.4% YoY in 2023, reaching RM776m, as a decline in cataract surgeries was offset by growth in refractive surgeries, which generated higher revenue per eye, based on our research. For 2024, industry revenue is forecasted to rise by 9.5% YoY to RM850m in 2024, mainly supported by the increasing adoption more advanced refractive technologies such as ZEISS SMILE Pro.\nGoing into 2025, we believe the 9.5% YoY industry growth to be primarily driven by volume expansion, in line with Optimax\u2019s guidance of improving demand in both cataract and refractive surgeries from 3Q 2025 onwards. This momentum is further supported by the recent recruitment of an ophthalmologist in Sep 2025 at the Johor Bahru ACC and the onboarding of Prudential as a panel insurer since 2Q2025",

From 3Q2022 to 3Q2024, Optimax embarked on an aggressive expansion phase, opening eight satellite clinics and four ACCs. This drove a rise in pre-operating setup costs, which included: the early recruitment of doctors, nurses, optometrists, and support staff ahead of operations, higher depreciation and lease payments on right-of-use assets, consultancy and professional fees tied to the Cambodian ACC, as well as increased marketing expenses to support the rollout of new ACCs and an aesthetic clinic in newly penetrated areas.\nAs a regulatory requirement, Optimax must appoint at least one doctor before applying to the MoH Malaysia for approval to operate an ACC, satellite clinic, or hospital. Given the approval process is often uncertain and can take up to a year, this has proven to be margin dilutive. Notably, front-loaded setup costs amounted to c.RM3m in 2024, of which c.80% was attributed to doctors\u2019 front-loading fees.\nGiven the nature of operating costs are typically front-loaded while revenue ramp-up is back-loaded, this expansion phase resulted in declining profit margins (Figure #9) and a weakening balance sheet (Figure #10) since 3Q2022. From 4Q2024, Optimax has transitioned into the asset-milking stage \u2013 a phase typically characterised by a profit margin upcycle through economies of scale and progressive deleveraging, thereby strengthening the Group\u2019s overall balance sheet profile.

Unlike the Malaysian expansion wave during 3Q2022-3Q2024, front-loaded setup costs are expected to be minimal.
