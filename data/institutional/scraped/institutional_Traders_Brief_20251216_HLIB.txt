December seasonal tailwinds, Fed rate-cut optimism, and a firmer ringgit. A decisive
break above 1,641 (key downtrend resistance) would pave the way for further upside
toward 1,659 (52-week high) and 1,686 (110% FE). Conversely, failure to clear this level
could see the market consolidate, with supports at 1,631 (90% FR), 1,620, and 1,600
(uptrend line).
