Trader Brief
Technical view: Drifting sideways before eyeing a triangle breakout
Despite near-term sideways consolidation, we stay constructive on the KLCI, which is
poised for a bullish triangle breakout backed by strong December seasonality and rising
Fed-cut optimism. A sustained close above immediate resistance at 1,622/20D MA would
pave the way for an imminent breakout above the upper trendline near 1,641, paving way
to revisit 1,659 (52-week high) and 1,686 (110% FE). Failure to break this hurdle may
keep the index in consolidation, with supports at 1,600 (lower trendline).
