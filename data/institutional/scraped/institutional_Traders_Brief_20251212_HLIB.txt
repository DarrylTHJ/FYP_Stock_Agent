Sources: HLIB, Bursa ride above its support trendline and reclaimed above 20D MA/ 1,619, supported by
strong December seasonality and continued Fed-cut optimism. This would open the
door for a breakout above the upper trendline near 1,641, setting up a move toward
1,659 (52-week high) and 1,686 (110% FE). Failure to clear this hurdle may keep the
index in consolidation, with support seen at 1,600 (trendline) and 1,595 (100D MA).
